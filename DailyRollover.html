        &emsp; This set of dashboards focuses on the exams whose dictations are not completed on the same day as the exam was performed.
        The main parameter used across these dashboards is the ‘Reference Hour’, the hour of the day at which a new date begins on the radiologists shift calendar.
        The selection of reference hour can impact which reports are seen as rollover exams.
        <br>
        &emsp; All plots in this report can be visualized in either Creation View or Dictation View. Creation View shows the exams based on their date of creation whereas
        Dictation View shows the exams relative to the date of dictation. This option, which is labeled as Rollover View, is thus a choice of how to attribute the exams that
        existed on two days.
